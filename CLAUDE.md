# TensorFeed.ai

TensorFeed.ai is an AI news aggregator and real-time data hub built for humans and AI agents. It combines editorial RSS news aggregation, model/pricing tracking, live service status monitoring, agent discovery, and original editorial content into one dashboard. The site is designed to be machine-readable first (llms.txt, JSON feeds, open API) with a dark-themed human UI on top.

Domain: https://tensorfeed.ai
GitHub: https://github.com/RipperMercs/tensorfeed
Sister site: https://terminalfeed.io (real-time data dashboard, free public API)

## Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 14 App Router, static export (`output: 'export'` in next.config.mjs)
- **Hosting**: Cloudflare Pages, auto-deploys from `main` branch on github.com/RipperMercs/tensorfeed
- **API / Backend**: Cloudflare Worker `tensorfeed-api` in `worker/`, auto-deploys on push to `main`
- **Routing**: Worker is attached to `tensorfeed.ai/api/*` so the Pages static site and Worker API share one domain
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, dark theme default with light mode toggle via ThemeProvider
- **Data storage**: Cloudflare Workers KV (3 namespaces, see below)
- **Fonts**: JetBrains Mono (data, code, numbers), Inter (body text)
- **Analytics**: Cloudflare Web Analytics (no cookies, no external trackers)
- **Ads**: Google AdSense (pub-7224757913262984)
- **Email**: Resend API for outage alerts and daily ops summary (sending domain: alerts@tensorfeed.ai)
- **Domain & DNS**: Cloudflare

```

Worker deploy (from `worker/` directory):
```bash
cd worker
wrangler deploy                          # deploy to production
wrangler secret put RESEND_API_KEY       # set secret
wrangler tail                            # live log stream
```

Manual data refresh (triggers all polls immediately):
```
GET https://tensorfeed.ai/api/refresh?key=production
```

## Cloudflare Workers KV Namespaces

- `TENSORFEED_NEWS`: `4924c4d8a64446cea111fd63a5b3455a`: articles, feeds, podcasts
- `TENSORFEED_STATUS`: `68eec8e4d37349a6adc1278c9280f653`: status pages, incidents
- `TENSORFEED_CACHE`: `4de30d8becd24b3bba9556b98bad8e69`: request cache, rate-limit state, misc, plus all agent-payments state under the `pay:*` and `history:*` prefixes:
  - `history:{YYYY-MM-DD}:{type}`: daily snapshots (pricing, models, benchmarks, status, agent-activity)
  - `history:index`: ordered list of dates with snapshot data
  - `pay:credits:{token}`: `{ balance, created, last_used, agent_ua, total_purchased }` (no TTL)
  - `pay:tx:{txHash}`: `{ amount_usd, credits, token, block_number, created }` (no TTL, replay protection)
  - `pay:quote:{nonce}`: `{ amount_usd, credits, expires_at }` (30-min TTL)
  - `pay:rollup:{YYYY-MM-DD}`: daily revenue + usage rollup with per-endpoint breakdown and top-agents leaderboard
  - `rate:routing-preview:{YYYY-MM-DD}:{ip}`: free preview rate limit counter (2-day TTL)

## KV Operation Limits (CRITICAL)

Cloudflare free tier allows 100,000 KV operations per day. To stay within budget:
- Batch KV writes. Never write on every request.
- Cache reads in Worker memory for 30 to 60 seconds.
- Use Cloudflare Cache API (free, unlimited) as the primary read layer. Only fall back to KV on cache miss.
- Agent activity logging must be batched, not per-request.
- Daily cron jobs should write once per run, not per item.

## Worker Cron Schedule

Defined in `worker/wrangler.toml`. All cron handlers dispatched from `worker/src/index.ts` `scheduled()` export.

- `*/5 * * * *`: Status page polling (every 5 min)
- `*/10 * * * *`: RSS feed fetching (every 10 min)
- `0 * * * *`: Hourly full refresh (RSS + status + podcasts)
- `0 7 * * *`: Daily 7am UTC: models, benchmarks, agents catalog update (LiteLLM + HuggingFace), then daily history snapshot capture (`worker/src/history.ts`, Phase 0 of agent payments)
- `30 8 * * *`: Daily 8:30am UTC: trending AI repos from GitHub
- `30 14 * * *`: Daily 2:30pm UTC: X/Twitter post (1/day, see X posting rules below)

## Data Flow

1. Worker cron polls RSS, status pages, podcasts, trending repos. Writes to KV.
2. Worker exposes that data at `/api/*` endpoints.
3. Next.js `prebuild` step (`scripts/fetch-feeds.ts`) pulls the latest from the Worker API and writes snapshots to `data/*.json`.
4. Next.js build bakes `data/*.json` into the static export so pages render correctly even if the Worker is down.
5. Client-side components (e.g. HomeFeed) hydrate with fresh data from `/api/news` after mount.

Fallback: Worker keeps rolling snapshots in KV. If a live poll returns empty or fails, `snapshots.ts` restores the previous known-good payload so the public API never serves blank data. `alerts.ts` sends an email if news staleness exceeds thresholds and sends a daily ops summary.

## Chaos Engineering Headers (free, all endpoints)

`worker/src/chaos.ts` short-circuits the worker before any route dispatch when a request includes a chaos header. `X-TensorFeed-Simulate-Error: <400-599>` returns the requested status code with a body that declares the response is simulated; the response includes `X-TensorFeed-Simulated: true`. `X-TensorFeed-Simulate-Latency: <ms>` sleeps the requested duration before continuing (capped at 10000ms via `CHAOS_LIMITS.MAX_LATENCY_MS`). Both headers are free, no-auth, and never charge credits because the simulated-error path returns before `requirePayment` runs. Wired in `worker/src/index.ts` at the top of `fetch()`. Tests in `worker/src/chaos.test.ts`. Documented on `/developers/agent-payments#chaos-engineering` and `/api/meta`.

## Circuit Breaker (premium endpoints)

`worker/src/circuit-breaker.ts` is an in-memory, isolate-local sliding-window counter that trips after 20 identical premium requests from a single bearer token in 60 seconds. Tripping returns HTTP 429 `infinite_loop_detected` with a 120-second cooldown and a `Retry-After` header, and no credits are charged. The fingerprint is `(token-prefix-16, path, sorted-query)`; bodies are not hashed (all premium endpoints are GET today). Wired into `requirePayment` in `worker/src/payments.ts` between token validation and balance debit via the `checkRequestCircuit` helper, so the breaker fires before any KV write. State is GC'd when the tracker exceeds `MAX_TRACKED_KEYS=5000`. Distributed loops across isolates leak through (acceptable tradeoff to avoid burning KV ops budget). Tests in `worker/src/circuit-breaker.test.ts`. Documented on `/developers/agent-payments#circuit-breaker` and `/api/meta`.

## View as Agent toggle (frontend)

Every page has a `HUMAN | AGENT` toggle in the navbar (and in the mobile menu). When toggled, a terminal-style overlay (`src/components/AgentView.tsx`) takes over the viewport and shows the raw API JSON powering the current route, the response status line, response headers, and the equivalent `curl` command. Route → endpoint mapping lives in `getRouteEndpoints` inside `AgentView.tsx`; default is `/api/meta`. Multiple endpoints per route are supported via clickable pills. Preference is persisted in a `view-mode` cookie and applied early via the inline script in `src/app/layout.tsx` to prevent flash. CSS lives in the View as Agent overlay block in `src/app/globals.css` (scanlines, CRT flicker, JSON syntax classes). State is held in `src/components/ViewModeProvider.tsx`. This is a DX/marketing feature, not a separate API surface; the data is the same `/api/*` endpoints documented above.

## API Endpoints

All mounted under `https://tensorfeed.ai/api/*` via the Worker.

**Free, no auth:**
- `/api/news`: Articles. Supports `?category=` and `?limit=`
- `/api/status`, `/api/status/summary`: Live service status for tracked providers
- `/api/models`: Model pricing, context windows, specs
- `/api/benchmarks`: AI model benchmark scores
- `/api/incidents`: Historical incident database
- `/api/agents/activity`, `/api/agents/news`, `/api/agents/status`, `/api/agents/pricing`, `/api/agents/directory`: Agent-friendly aliases
- `/api/podcasts`, `/api/trending-repos`
- `/api/health`, `/api/ping`, `/api/meta`, `/api/cron-status`, `/api/snapshots`, `/api/alerts-status`
- `/api/history`, `/api/history/{YYYY-MM-DD}/{type}`: Daily historical snapshots (Phase 0 of agent payments)
- `/api/preview/routing?task=code|reasoning|creative|general&budget=&min_quality=`: Free top-1 routing recommendation (5 calls/day per IP)
- `/api/payment/info`: Wallet, pricing tiers, supported flows, verification metadata
- `/api/payment/buy-credits` (POST): Generate a 30-min payment quote with memo nonce
- `/api/payment/confirm` (POST): Verify USDC tx on-chain, mint a bearer token
- `/api/payment/balance`: Read remaining credits for the current bearer token
- `/api/payment/usage`: Per-token call history (last 100 calls aggregated by endpoint). Auth required, no credit cost. Powers the human /account dashboard.
- `/api/payment/history`: Per-token credit-purchase audit log (which on-chain txs added how many credits and when). Auth required (`Authorization: Bearer <token>`), no credit cost. Pairs with `/api/payment/usage` (spend side) to give the bearer's full token lifecycle. Backed by `pay:purchases:{token}` ring buffer (cap 100); tokens minted before this ledger existed return an empty `purchases` array but still expose `current_balance` and `token_short`.
- `/api/alerts/subscribe`: Outage alert email signup
- `/api/refresh?key=production[&task=history]`: Manual data refresh / history capture trigger

**Paid (USDC on Base, credits-first):**
- `/api/premium/routing`: Tier 2 routing engine, 1 credit per call. Top-N ranked recommendations with full composite score breakdown.
- `/api/premium/history/pricing/series?model=&from=&to=`: Tier 1, 1 credit. Daily input/output/blended price points for one model with min/max/delta summary. Range capped at 90 days.
- `/api/premium/history/benchmarks/series?model=&benchmark=&from=&to=`: Tier 1, 1 credit. Score evolution for a single benchmark on one model. Returns delta in percentage points.
- `/api/premium/history/status/uptime?provider=&from=&to=`: Tier 1, 1 credit. Daily uptime % for one provider (degraded counts as half) with incident-day list. Missing-data days excluded from denominator.
- `/api/premium/history/compare?from=&to=&type=pricing|benchmarks`: Tier 1, 1 credit. Diff two daily snapshots: added, removed, changed entries with deltas.
- `/api/premium/watches` (POST): Tier 1, 1 credit per registration. Body `{ spec, callback_url, secret?, fire_cap? }`. Spec is `{ type: "price"|"status"|"digest", ... }`. Price/status fire on transitions; digest fires on a daily/weekly cadence with a pricing-changes summary. Watch lives 90 days, default fire cap 100. Fires deliver HMAC-signed POST to callback URL.
- `/api/premium/watches` (GET): List watches owned by the bearer token. Free.
- `/api/premium/watches/{id}` (GET|DELETE): Read or remove an owned watch. Free.
- `/api/premium/agents/directory?category=&status=&open_source=&capability=&sort=&limit=`: Tier 1, 1 credit. Enriched agents catalog joined with live status, recent news (count + top 3), agent traffic, flagship pricing, and a derived trending_score. Sort options: trending, alphabetical, status, price_low, price_high, news_count.
- `/api/premium/news/search?q=&from=&to=&provider=&category=&limit=`: Tier 1, 1 credit. Full-text search over the article corpus with relevance scoring (term hits weighted 3 in title, 1 in snippet, plus recency boost) and date/provider/category filters. Default limit 25, max 100.
- `/api/premium/cost/projection?model=&input_tokens_per_day=&output_tokens_per_day=&horizon=`: Tier 1, 1 credit. Project the cost of a token-usage workload across 1-10 models (CSV in `model`). Returns daily/weekly/monthly/yearly totals per model and a ranking by cheapest monthly. Pure compute on live pricing.
- `/api/premium/forecast?target=price|benchmark&model=&field=&benchmark=&lookback=&horizon=`: Tier 1, 1 credit. Conservative linear-regression forecast (95% prediction interval) for one model price field or benchmark score, projected 1-30 days forward. Confidence label (low/medium/high) reflects fit quality and sample size. Returns explicit "not a guarantee" disclaimers.
- `/api/premium/providers/{name}`: Tier 1, 1 credit. One provider's complete profile in one call: live status + components, all models with pricing + tier + benchmark scores joined, recent news (top 8), agent traffic. Aggregation over 4 free endpoints; agents pay 1 credit instead of stitching client-side.
- `/api/premium/compare/models?ids=`: Tier 1, 1 credit. Side-by-side comparison of 2-5 models with pricing, benchmarks (union-of-keys normalized to null for missing), status, news. Plus rankings (cheapest_blended, most_context, by_benchmark leaderboard).
- `/api/premium/whats-new?days=&news_limit=`: Tier 1, 1 credit. Agent morning brief: pricing changes, new/removed models, status incidents, top news headlines from last 1-7 days. Single call instead of stitching free endpoints client-side.

**Admin (auth-gated via `?key=ENVIRONMENT`):**
- `/api/admin/usage?date=YYYY-MM-DD`: Daily revenue + usage rollup
- `/api/admin/usage/dates`: List of dates with rollup data

**Internal (server-to-server only, NOT in `/api/meta` or `/llms.txt`):**
- `/api/internal/validate-and-charge` (POST): Sister-site Workers (TerminalFeed and any future Pizza Robot Studios sister site like VR.org) call this with `X-Internal-Auth: ${SHARED_INTERNAL_SECRET}` to validate a TensorFeed bearer token and atomically debit credits. Body: `{ token, cost, endpoint }`. Always returns HTTP 200 with `{ok: true, credits_remaining}` or `{ok: false, reason}`; only 401/405/400 for auth/method/body failures. Auth check runs BEFORE body parsing so 401 does not leak endpoint existence. Constant-time secret compare. Backed by `validateAndCharge` helper in `worker/src/payments.ts` which is the same atomic-charge logic that `requirePayment` uses internally for in-process callers.
- `/api/internal/track-bot` (POST): Receives bot hits from the Cloudflare Pages Functions middleware at `functions/_middleware.ts` so static editorial / SEO route hits (e.g. `/originals/*`, `/api-reference/*`, `/for-ai-agents`) land in the same in-memory buffer as Worker-route hits. Body: `{ bot, path }`. `X-Internal-Auth: ${PAGES_TRACK_SECRET}` constant-time compare. Dedicated secret (separate from `SHARED_INTERNAL_SECRET`) so its rotation cadence is independent of cross-site coordination. Calls `trackBotHitDirect()` in `worker/src/activity.ts`. The middleware skips API/feed paths so we never double-count.

Every new endpoint MUST be documented on `/developers` (or `/developers/agent-payments` for paid endpoints), added to `/api/meta`, and linked from `public/llms.txt`.

## Content Rules

- **No em dashes anywhere**. Not in code comments, UI text, articles, meta tags, alt text, nowhere. This is strict.
- **No double hyphens (`--`) as a substitute for em dashes**. Same rule, same scope.
- Use commas, periods, colons, semicolons, or parentheses. Rewrite the sentence if needed.
- This is an anti-AI-detection measure so editorial content reads as naturally human-written.
- All article cards link back to the original source. Never republish full third-party content.
- Original editorial content lives only under `/originals`.
- RSS snippets are clipped to 150 to 200 characters max.
- Vary article dates naturally when writing new editorial content.
- Vary article lengths by subject matter. Short paragraphs. Vary sentence length.
- Write in first person from the TensorFeed brand voice. Include specific data points and opinions.
- Every page needs a unique title tag, meta description, JSON-LD schema, and OG tags.
- Every new page must be added to the sitemap and `llms.txt`.

## SEO

- `sitemap.xml` generated dynamically from `src/app/sitemap.ts` (45+ URLs)
- `robots.txt` explicitly welcomes all AI crawlers by name
- `llms.txt` and `llms-full.txt` for agent discovery
- IndexNow integration, auto-pings on content change (key in `worker/wrangler.toml` vars)
- Cloudflare Crawler Hints enabled
- FAQPage schema on all pillar/guide pages
- Article schema on all `/originals` posts
- WebSite + Organization schema in root layout
- Google Search Console and Bing Webmaster Tools verified

## Code Style

- TypeScript strict mode. No `any` types.
- React functional components with hooks. No class components.
- Tailwind CSS only. No CSS modules, no styled-components.
- Use CSS custom properties (variables) for theming colors.
- Semantic HTML: `<article>`, `<nav>`, `<aside>`, `<main>`, `<section>`.
- ARIA labels on all interactive elements.
- Skeleton loaders for loading states.
- Graceful fallback UI for error states.

## Security Rules

- **Never hardcode API keys as fallbacks**. No `|| 'sk-ant-...'` patterns. If an env var is missing, throw an error.
- Store all secrets as Cloudflare Worker secrets via `wrangler secret put NAME`. Never commit them.
- `.env`, `.env.*`, and `worker/.env*` are gitignored. Keep it that way.
- Pre-commit hook (`.husky/pre-commit`) greps staged diffs for key patterns (`sk-ant-`, `sk-proj-`, `AIza`, `re_`, `github_pat`). Do not bypass with `--no-verify`.
- Verify repo visibility (public vs private) before assessing severity of any leaked secret. `RipperMercs/tensorfeed` is currently public, so any secret in git history is world-readable and must be rotated.

## Agent Payments (Phase 1, shipped 2026-04-27)

TensorFeed sells premium API access to AI agents via USDC on Base mainnet. No accounts, no API keys, no traditional payment processors. Decision locked 2026-04-27: USDC-only, no Stripe.

**Wallet:** `0x549c82e6bfc54bdae9a2073744cbc2af5d1fc6d1` (Rabby on Base, self-custodied)
**USDC contract on Base:** `0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913`
**Pricing:** 50 credits per $1 USDC base rate. Volume discounts at $5 (10%), $30 (25%), $200 (40%). Tier 2 routing currently 1 credit per call.

Architecture (full detail in `AGENT-PAYMENTS-SPEC.md`):
- Credits-first flow primary, x402 per-call as fallback for one-off discovery
- Bearer token (`tf_live_<256-bit hex>`) is a debit account; each premium call decrements credits
- On-chain verification reads the USDC Transfer event from `eth_getTransactionReceipt` on Base RPC
- Replay protection: every used tx hash is permanently recorded in `pay:tx:{txHash}` (no TTL)
- Trust attestation via TLS + multi-publication (llms.txt, /api/payment/info, GitHub README, X bio); no DNS TXT signing in MVP

Key modules:
- `worker/src/payments.ts`: middleware (`requirePayment`), USDC verification, quote/confirm/balance, daily rollup analytics
- `worker/src/routing.ts`: routing engine + free preview rate limiter
- `worker/src/history.ts`: daily snapshot capture (the data moat)
- `worker/src/history-series.ts`: premium aggregated views (series, uptime, compare) over the daily snapshots
- `worker/src/watches.ts`: premium webhook watches; status dispatch hooks into `pollStatusPages` (every 5 min), price dispatch runs daily after `updateCatalog`

SDKs:
- Python: `sdk/python/` (1.2.0). `pip install tensorfeed[web3]` enables `tf.purchase_credits()` for one-call sign-and-send. See `sdk/python/PUBLISHING.md` for the PyPI release flow.
- TypeScript: `sdk/javascript/` (1.1.0). Mirrors the Python surface, uses native fetch.

Frontend docs: `/developers/agent-payments` (Next.js page) covers the wallet, pricing, both flows, all endpoints, and code examples. `/terms` Premium API and Agent Payments section is structured into numbered subsections 17.1 through 17.15 covering the inference-only license, no-refunds policy, replay protection, cross-site applicability, sanctions warranty, autonomous-agent acknowledgment, suspension/revocation, AUP, liability cap, chargeback handling, and no-MSB representation. Premium API data practices are in `/privacy` Section 4B.

## OFAC Sanctions Screening (shipped 2026-04-28)

The full Premium API legal hardening from `terminalfeed/cc-spec-tensorfeed-premium-compliance.md` is now live across all four sections:

- Section 1 (Terms §17.9-17.15, no-refunds, governing law and venue): `53e6741`
- Section 2 (Privacy §4B Premium API data practices, Chainalysis disclosure, 7-year retention): `dff1c64`
- Section 4 (geo-IP block on `/api/payment/buy-credits` for CU/IR/KP/SY): `974441b`
- Section 3 (Chainalysis wallet-level screening on `/api/payment/confirm` and the x402 fallback)

`screenWalletOFAC` in `worker/src/payments.ts` calls the free Chainalysis public sanctions API. Misconfig (no `CHAINALYSIS_API_KEY` secret) fails closed with HTTP 503 so credits cannot be minted without a screen. Sanctioned wallets return HTTP 403 `sanctions_block` and the block is logged via `console.log` (always) and persisted to the `OFAC_AUDIT_LOG` KV namespace if bound (7-year TTL per privacy policy retention). Transient Chainalysis errors fail open with an `ofac_screen_degraded` log line. The sender wallet is extracted from the USDC Transfer event `topics[1]` inside `verifyBaseUSDCTransaction`. Both the credits flow (`confirmPayment`) and the x402 per-call fallback (`requirePayment`) gate on the screen before any token is minted.

Optional follow-up for compliance audit trail beyond Workers' default ~3-day log retention: bind an `OFAC_AUDIT_LOG` KV namespace. The screening helper writes to it conditionally so the unbound case is a no-op.

## Testing

The Worker has Vitest unit tests under `worker/src/*.test.ts`. Run from the `worker/` directory:

```bash
cd worker
npm install   # one-time, pulls vitest
npm test      # vitest run
npm run test:watch
```

Current coverage: routing engine (quality weighting per task, cost normalization, filters, custom weights, edge cases). Future: payment middleware (mock RPC), history capture, request handlers.

## Social

- X/Twitter: [@tensorfeed](https://twitter.com/tensorfeed)

### X/Twitter posting (strict cadence, do not break)

Auto-posting is handled by `worker/src/twitter.ts` on the `30 14 * * *` cron.

Account was flagged as spam on 2026-04-04 from posting 5x/day via automated cron. Auto-posting was re-enabled at 1/day on 2026-04-12. The manual `/api/tweet` endpoint remains disabled to prevent accidental bursts.

Cadence ramp, do not skip steps:
- Through 2026-05-04: 1 post/day max
- After 30 clean days (2026-05-04+): 2 posts/day (cron becomes `30 8,17 * * *`)
- After 60+ clean days (~2026-06-03+): 3 to 4 posts/day max, never more
- Never exceed 5 posts/day on any account under 6 months old
- Any new flag resets the clock to 1/day

## When Building New Features

1. Create the page or component under `src/app` or `src/components`
2. Add a unique title tag and meta description
3. Add JSON-LD schema (Article, FAQPage, etc as appropriate)
4. Add OG meta tags
5. Add the route to `src/app/sitemap.ts`
6. Add the route to `public/llms.txt`
7. If it adds a new API endpoint, implement it in `worker/src/index.ts` and document it on `/developers` and in `/api/meta`
8. Test on mobile viewports
9. Ensure zero em dashes and zero double hyphens in any text
10. Commit and push to `main`. Cloudflare Pages deploys the site, and the Worker redeploys on any `worker/**` change.
