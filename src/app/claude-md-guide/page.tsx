    question: 'What is a CLAUDE.md file?',
    answer:
      'CLAUDE.md is a markdown configuration file that Claude Code reads automatically at the start of every session. It acts as persistent project memory, giving Claude context about your codebase, coding style, architecture decisions, and workflow preferences without you needing to repeat yourself.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Where should I put my CLAUDE.md file?',
    answer:
      'You can place CLAUDE.md at three levels: globally at ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md (applies to all projects), at your project root alongside package.json or similar config files (applies to that project), or in subdirectories for folder-specific instructions. All three levels merge together when Claude Code starts a session.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How long should a CLAUDE.md file be?',
    answer:
      'Aim for 40 to 80 lines. Shorter files risk missing important context, while longer files dilute the signal. Focus on information that actually changes how Claude behaves. If a rule does not affect code output, it probably does not belong in CLAUDE.md.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the difference between CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md?',
    answer:
      'CLAUDE.md is specific to Claude Code (Anthropic). AGENTS.md is an open standard supported by multiple AI coding tools including Cursor, Zed, and OpenCode. They serve the same purpose: giving AI context about your project. Some teams include both files to support multiple tools.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Does CLAUDE.md work with Claude on the web (claude.ai)?',
    answer:
      'No. CLAUDE.md is only read by Claude Code, the command-line coding agent. The web interface at claude.ai uses Projects with custom instructions instead, which serve a similar purpose but are configured through the UI rather than a file.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Should I commit CLAUDE.md to version control?',
    answer:
      'Yes, absolutely. Your project-level CLAUDE.md should be committed to git so that every team member and CI environment gets the same instructions. The global ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md is personal and stays on your machine.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I create a CLAUDE.md file quickly?',
    answer:
      'The fastest way is to run the /init command inside Claude Code, which generates a starter CLAUDE.md based on your project structure. You can also use our interactive generator at tensorfeed.ai/claude-md-generator to build one from a template, or copy one of our examples at tensorfeed.ai/claude-md-examples.',

          <strong className="text-text-primary">CLAUDE.md</strong> is a markdown configuration file
          that Claude Code reads at the start of every session. It gives Claude persistent memory
          about your project: your tech stack, coding conventions, architecture decisions, and
          workflow rules. Think of it as a README for your AI coding assistant. Instead of repeating
          instructions every conversation, you write them once in CLAUDE.md and Claude follows them
          automatically.

        If you use Claude Code for development, CLAUDE.md is the single most impactful file you can
        add to your project. A well-written CLAUDE.md eliminates repetitive prompting, enforces
        consistent code style across sessions, and turns Claude from a generic assistant into a
        teammate that actually understands your codebase. This guide covers everything: what to
        include, where to put it, how the loading hierarchy works, real examples, and common
        mistakes to avoid.

          CLAUDE.md is a plain markdown file that{' '}
          <Link href="/best-ai-tools#coding" className="text-accent-primary hover:underline">Claude Code</Link>{' '}
          (Anthropic&apos;s CLI coding agent) reads automatically every time it starts a new
          session in your project. The file contains instructions, context, and rules written in
          natural language. Claude treats its contents as high-priority system context, similar to
          how a new developer would read a project&apos;s contributing guide before writing their
          first pull request.
        </p>
        <p className="text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-4">
          The concept is simple but powerful. Without CLAUDE.md, you start every Claude Code session
          from scratch. Claude has no memory of your preferences, your project&apos;s architecture,
          or the conventions your team follows. You end up repeating the same instructions: &quot;Use
          TypeScript strict mode,&quot; &quot;We use Tailwind, not CSS modules,&quot; &quot;Always
          write tests for new functions.&quot; CLAUDE.md eliminates that friction entirely.
        </p>
        <p className="text-text-secondary leading-relaxed">
          Once you add a CLAUDE.md file to your project, Claude Code reads it before processing your
          first prompt. Every instruction in the file shapes how Claude writes code, responds to
          questions, and makes decisions throughout the session. It is persistent, versioned (since
          you commit it to git), and shared across your entire team.

            <p className="text-text-secondary text-sm leading-relaxed">
              Without CLAUDE.md, Claude might use different patterns in different sessions. One day
              it writes React class components, the next day functional components. One session it
              uses CSS modules, the next it uses styled-components. CLAUDE.md locks in your
              preferences so the output stays consistent every time.

            <p className="text-text-secondary text-sm leading-relaxed">
              If you find yourself typing the same instructions at the start of every session, that
              is a sign you need CLAUDE.md. Write it once, and Claude remembers it for every future
              interaction in that project.

            <p className="text-text-secondary text-sm leading-relaxed">
              When CLAUDE.md is committed to your repo, every developer on the team gets the same
              Claude behavior. Junior developers, senior developers, and contractors all get code
              output that follows the same conventions. It is like an enforced style guide that
              Claude actually follows.

              New team members can read your CLAUDE.md to quickly understand the project&apos;s
              architecture, conventions, and key commands. It doubles as lightweight documentation
              that is always up to date because you maintain it for Claude anyway.

              By encoding architectural decisions and code review standards into CLAUDE.md, you
              catch issues before they happen. Claude will follow your patterns for error handling,

        <p className="text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Understanding the loading hierarchy helps you decide what goes where. When Claude Code
          starts a session, it follows this order:
        </p>
        <ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-3 text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-4">
          <li>
            <strong className="text-text-primary">Global CLAUDE.md</strong> loads first from
            ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md. This sets your baseline personal preferences.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong className="text-text-primary">Project root CLAUDE.md</strong> loads next. Its
            instructions layer on top of (and can override) the global file.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong className="text-text-primary">Subdirectory CLAUDE.md</strong> files load as
            Claude navigates into specific folders. These add folder-specific context on top of
            everything above.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p className="text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-4">
          All three levels combine into a single context that Claude uses throughout the session.
          There is no conflict resolution needed in most cases because each level typically covers
          different concerns. Your global file handles personal style, the project root handles
          architecture, and subdirectory files handle folder-specific details.
        </p>
        <p className="text-text-secondary leading-relaxed">
          If instructions genuinely conflict (for example, your global file says &quot;use
          spaces&quot; but the project file says &quot;use tabs&quot;), the more specific file wins.
          Project-level overrides global, and subdirectory-level overrides project-level.

          A bloated CLAUDE.md is almost as bad as no CLAUDE.md. When the file gets too long, key

          The content format is nearly identical. If your team uses multiple AI coding tools, the
          simplest approach is to maintain both files with the same content. Some developers create
          one file and symlink the other. Others maintain a single AGENTS.md and a minimal CLAUDE.md
          that points to it.

          Claude Code reads CLAUDE.md by default. It does not currently read AGENTS.md unless you
