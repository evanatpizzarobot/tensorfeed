        <p className="text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to computer systems designed to perform tasks that
          typically require human intelligence. This includes recognizing patterns, understanding
          language, making decisions, solving problems, and learning from experience. The key word
          is &quot;intelligence&quot; because these systems go beyond following rigid, pre-programmed
          instructions. Instead, they adapt and improve based on the data they process.
        </p>
        <p className="text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-4">
          In practical terms, AI is the technology behind your phone&apos;s voice assistant, the
          recommendation engine that suggests your next show on Netflix, the spam filter in your
          email, and the chatbots that can now hold remarkably human-like conversations. At its
          core, AI is about building systems that can perceive their environment, reason about it,
          and take actions to achieve goals.
        </p>
        <p className="text-text-secondary leading-relaxed">
          It is worth noting that &quot;AI&quot; is a broad umbrella term. When most people talk
          about AI in 2026, they are usually referring to machine learning systems and, more
          specifically, large language models (LLMs) like{' '}

              &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; at the Dartmouth Conference. Early researchers

        <p className="text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Every AI system in production today is narrow AI. This includes ChatGPT, Google Search,
          Tesla&apos;s autopilot, and AlphaFold. These systems can be astonishingly good at their
          designated tasks, sometimes far surpassing human performance, but they cannot transfer
          that ability to unrelated domains. A chess AI cannot write poetry. An image generator
          cannot diagnose diseases (unless specifically trained to do so).
        </p>
        <p className="text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-4">
          That said, modern LLMs blur this line. Models like Claude, GPT-4o, and Gemini can handle
          a remarkably wide range of tasks: coding, writing, analysis, math, translation, and more.
          Some researchers argue these models are approaching &quot;broad&quot; AI, even if they are
          not truly general.

        <p className="text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-4">
          AGI would be a system that can learn and perform any intellectual task a human can. It
          would understand context, transfer knowledge between domains, reason about novel situations,
          and set its own goals. No system has achieved AGI yet, though several companies, including
          OpenAI and DeepMind, have stated it is their explicit goal. Timelines vary wildly, with
          predictions ranging from 2027 to &quot;never.&quot;

          ASI is a hypothetical future AI that surpasses the smartest humans in every domain,
          including creativity, social intelligence, and scientific reasoning. This concept is mostly
          discussed in the context of AI safety and long-term risk. It remains firmly in the realm

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-text-primary mb-3">How Machine Learning Works</h3>
        <p className="text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Instead of being explicitly programmed with rules, a machine learning system is trained
          on data. You give it thousands (or millions) of examples, and it finds patterns. For
          instance, show an ML model millions of emails labeled &quot;spam&quot; or &quot;not
          spam,&quot; and it learns to classify new emails on its own. The three main types of ML
          are supervised learning (labeled data), unsupervised learning (finding hidden patterns),
          and reinforcement learning (learning through trial and reward).
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-text-primary mb-3">How Deep Learning Works</h3>
        <p className="text-text-secondary leading-relaxed">
          Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with
          many layers (hence &quot;deep&quot;). Each layer processes the data at a higher level of
          abstraction. In image recognition, early layers might detect edges, middle layers detect
          shapes, and later layers recognize objects. The transformer architecture, introduced in
          2017, is the foundation of modern LLMs and has driven most of the recent progress in AI.

        <p className="text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Large language models are the technology behind ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and other AI
          chatbots. They are neural networks trained on enormous amounts of text data to predict
          what comes next in a sequence of words. Through this simple objective, they develop
          surprisingly sophisticated capabilities: they can write code, explain complex topics,
          translate languages, reason about problems, and much more.
        </p>
        <p className="text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-4">
          The &quot;large&quot; in LLM refers to the number of parameters (learnable values) in the
          model. Modern LLMs have anywhere from a few billion to over a trillion parameters. More
          parameters generally means more capability, though training data quality and techniques
          matter enormously too.

              AI refers to computer systems designed to perform tasks that normally require human
