          On April 27, Microsoft and OpenAI announced they were ending their exclusive cloud relationship.
          On April 28, OpenAI models, Codex, and a jointly built Managed Agents product went live on AWS
          Bedrock. That is not a partnership announcement. That is a product launch sitting on the shelf
          waiting for a press release.
        </p>

        <p>
          I&apos;ve covered enough multi-cloud rollouts to know the shape of the work. Standing up a
          frontier model on a new cloud is not a 24-hour project. The IAM integration alone is weeks of
          back and forth. The fact that AWS could ship three products on Bedrock the morning after the
          legal terms were inked tells you the engineering had been done in parallel for months. Both
          sides knew the divorce was coming, and both sides built for the day after.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-text-primary pt-4">What Actually Shipped</h2>

        <p>
          AWS announced three offerings, all in limited preview, with general availability promised
          within weeks. They are not minor: this is OpenAI&apos;s full enterprise stack landing on a
          competing cloud, with native AWS controls.
        </p>

        <div className="bg-bg-secondary border border-border rounded-lg overflow-x-auto">
          <table className="w-full text-sm">
            <thead>
              <tr className="border-b border-border">

              </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody className="divide-y divide-border">
              <tr>
                <td className="px-4 py-3 text-accent-primary font-medium">OpenAI Models on Bedrock</td>
                <td className="px-4 py-3">Frontier OpenAI models (GPT-5.5 included) callable through the same Bedrock InvokeModel API as Anthropic, Meta, and Mistral</td>
                <td className="px-4 py-3">IAM, PrivateLink, Guardrails, encryption, CloudTrail</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td className="px-4 py-3 text-accent-primary font-medium">Codex on Bedrock</td>
                <td className="px-4 py-3">OpenAI&apos;s coding agent runs in AWS environments, authenticates with AWS credentials, available via CLI, desktop app, and VS Code extension</td>
                <td className="px-4 py-3">IAM auth, Bedrock inference, AWS-native logging</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td className="px-4 py-3 text-accent-primary font-medium">Bedrock Managed Agents</td>
                <td className="px-4 py-3">Jointly built. Production agents with per-agent identity, action logging, customer-environment isolation, all inference on Bedrock</td>
                <td className="px-4 py-3">IAM identities, CloudTrail audit, customer VPC isolation</td>
              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>
        </div>

        <p>
          The middle row is the one that matters most for developers building agentic systems today. Codex
          on Bedrock means an enterprise team can run OpenAI&apos;s coding agent inside their existing
          AWS account, with the same IAM roles and CloudTrail audit logging they use for every other
          workload, and bill it through AWS. No separate OpenAI account, no new procurement cycle, no
          security team review of a second vendor&apos;s data flow. That is a category-killer for
          enterprises that have been blocked from OpenAI by their own cloud-vendor consolidation policies.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-text-primary pt-4">Bedrock Managed Agents Is the Real Story</h2>

        <p>
          The third product is the one most coverage is glossing over, and it is the most strategically
          important. Amazon Bedrock Managed Agents is jointly built by AWS and OpenAI, not just OpenAI
          shipping a model on AWS infrastructure. Each agent gets its own AWS IAM identity, every action
          is logged through CloudTrail, and the inference runs in the customer&apos;s own AWS environment.
        </p>

        <p>
          What that means in practice: enterprises can deploy an OpenAI-powered agent that can do things
          on their behalf, with the same identity-and-access primitives they already use for human
          employees and service principals. Want to give the agent read access to one S3 bucket and
          deny everything else? IAM policy. Want to revoke its access in an incident? IAM revoke. Want
          to audit every API call it made last quarter? CloudTrail query.
        </p>

        <p>
          That solves the single biggest blocker enterprises have raised about agentic AI for the past
          18 months: how do I give an agent permissions without giving it the keys to the kingdom, and
          how do I prove to my auditors what it did. Bedrock Managed Agents answers both questions with
          existing AWS primitives that compliance teams already understand.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-text-primary pt-4">What This Means for Microsoft</h2>

        <p>
          Microsoft kept first-look rights. OpenAI still has to ship to Azure first, and Microsoft holds
          non-exclusive IP rights through 2032. But Microsoft no longer collects revenue share when
          customers access OpenAI through Azure, which used to be a meaningful chunk of Azure&apos;s AI
          monetization.
        </p>

        <p>
          The strategic posture has shifted. For the past three years, the answer to &quot;where do I
          run OpenAI in production&quot; was Azure, with maybe a side path through OpenAI&apos;s direct
          API. As of yesterday, the answer is Azure or AWS, with Google Cloud expected to follow in the
          coming weeks. The next time an enterprise prices out an OpenAI deployment, they have leverage
          they did not have on Sunday.
        </p>

        <p>
          Microsoft is not in trouble. Azure still has a deeper bench of OpenAI-specific tooling
          (Foundry, Copilot Studio, the M365 integrations). What Microsoft has lost is the architectural
          assumption that OpenAI on Azure is the default. That assumption sold a lot of Azure commits.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-text-primary pt-4">Pricing Implications</h2>

        <p>
          Bedrock list pricing for OpenAI models has not been published yet for general availability,
          but historically Bedrock has matched the underlying provider&apos;s API pricing on a per-token
          basis, with AWS taking margin from the surrounding services rather than the inference. That
          pattern likely holds here. Expect GPT-5.5 on Bedrock at the same $5/$30 per million tokens
          you pay direct to OpenAI today.
        </p>

        <p>
          The interesting price signal is on commits. AWS is the master of multi-year reserved capacity.
          If a customer can lock GPT-5.5 inference into a Bedrock Provisioned Throughput contract,
          paying upfront for guaranteed tokens at a discount, that is a thing OpenAI&apos;s direct API
          does not offer in the same form. Watch for that announcement at AWS re:Invent in December.
        </p>

          <Link href="/tools/cost-calculator" className="text-accent-primary hover:underline">cost calculator</Link>{' '}
          on the assumption that direct API pricing carries to Bedrock. If you discover Bedrock is
          cheaper at scale, the spread is the rounding error.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-text-primary pt-4">What This Means for Anthropic</h2>

        <p>
          This is the part that gets less coverage but matters more long-term. Anthropic has been the
          flagship AI on Bedrock for two years. Claude Opus, Claude Sonnet, and Claude Haiku are the
          three Anthropic models most enterprises default to when they are buying AI through AWS. As
          of yesterday, GPT-5.5 sits on the same shelf, with the same IAM hooks, the same Guardrails,
          the same one-click region availability.
        </p>

        <p>
          Anthropic is not displaced. The Bedrock storefront has multiple top-shelf options now, which
          is the point of a marketplace. But Anthropic&apos;s &quot;default frontier model on AWS&quot;
          positioning just got contested. The recently announced{' '}
          <Link href="/originals/google-anthropic-40b-compute" className="text-accent-primary hover:underline">$40 billion Google compute deal</Link>{' '}
          becomes more important in this light. Anthropic needs Google to be the cloud where Claude is
          the obvious choice, because AWS is no longer that cloud.
        </p>

        <p>
          Expect Anthropic to respond with deeper Vertex AI integration over the next quarter.
          Specifically: Anthropic-tuned Vertex Agent Builder presets, joint Vertex+Anthropic security
          review patterns, maybe a Glasswing-adjacent Vertex offering. The cloud arms race for AI
          differentiation is moving from &quot;which models do you have&quot; to &quot;which models do
          you have the deepest tooling around.&quot;
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-text-primary pt-4">The 24-Hour Tell</h2>

        <p>
          One last note. The speed of this launch is the part the strategy press is underplaying.
          Stratechery published an interview with Sam Altman and Matt Garman about Bedrock Managed
          Agents within hours of the launch. AWS had marketing pages, deep technical docs, and a
          re:Invent-grade launch video ready. OpenAI had a coordinated blog post live. None of that
          gets done in 24 hours.
        </p>

        <p>
          Microsoft and OpenAI&apos;s lawyers worked through Sunday on the partnership reset. AWS and
          OpenAI&apos;s engineering teams had been working through every Sunday for months. The launch
          shipped on April 28 because it was already done; it just could not legally exist until April
          27. That is the shape of the new AI infrastructure market: every frontier provider is
          quietly building the multi-cloud rails before the contracts allow them to be used.
        </p>

        <p>
          OpenAI&apos;s Google Cloud launch is next. The same engineering pattern, the same already-built
          integration, the same waiting-for-legal cadence. It will land sooner than the press cycle
          expects. We will be tracking it, along with status and pricing on{' '}
          <Link href="/models" className="text-accent-primary hover:underline">our models page</Link> and{' '}
          <Link href="/status" className="text-accent-primary hover:underline">status dashboard</Link>{' '}
          as it ships.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-text-primary pt-4">Our Take</h2>

        <p>
          The era of frontier-model-as-cloud-exclusive is over. It ended on April 27, but it became
          visible on April 28. Every meaningful enterprise AI buyer now has multi-cloud OpenAI on the
          table. Every cloud provider is now either selling OpenAI directly or building harder against
          it. The model-vs-cloud bundling that defined 2023 to 2025 is gone.
        </p>

        <p>
          For developers, the practical change is simple: stop architecting around the assumption that
          your model and your cloud are coupled. The portability you wanted six months ago is here.
          Use it. Build with model-agnostic patterns and let the procurement team chase the price.
        </p>

        <p>
          For enterprise buyers, the leverage just shifted. If you are negotiating an AI commit, you
          have credible alternatives in three clouds now. Use them. The deals being signed this week
          will look very different from the deals signed last month.
        </p>
