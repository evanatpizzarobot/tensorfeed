          This was the biggest week in AI this year. It was not even close. Three major model drops
          landed within 48 hours of each other, a quarter-trillion dollar acquisition reshaped the
          competitive landscape, and one of the world&apos;s most cautious AI labs built a model so
          powerful they refused to release it.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you blinked, you missed at least two of these stories. Here is everything that happened
          and why it matters.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-text-primary pt-4">GPT-5.5: OpenAI&apos;s First Full Retrain Since GPT-4.5</h2>

        <p>
          OpenAI launched GPT-5.5 on April 23. This is not an incremental update. It is the first
          fully retrained base model OpenAI has shipped since GPT-4.5, which means new training data,
          new architecture decisions, new everything. The sticker shock is real: $5 per million input
          tokens and $30 per million output tokens, exactly double what GPT-5.4 cost.
        </p>

        <p>
          What do you get for that price? A 1 million token context window, top scores on every major
          benchmark, and noticeably stronger reasoning on complex multi-step problems. OpenAI is
          betting that developers will pay the premium for a model that genuinely outperforms rather
          than one that just iterates. Early reports from API users suggest the jump in quality is
          large enough to justify the cost for production workloads where accuracy matters more than
          volume.
        </p>

        <p>
          We covered the full details in our{' '}
          <Link href="/originals/gpt-5-5-openai-flagship" className="text-accent-primary hover:underline">
            dedicated GPT-5.5 breakdown
          </Link>. The short version: this is the model OpenAI needed to ship to prove they still set
          the pace.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-text-primary pt-4">DeepSeek V4: Open Source Keeps Closing the Gap</h2>

        <p>
          Less than 24 hours after GPT-5.5, the Chinese lab DeepSeek released V4 Flash and V4 Pro.
          Both are fully open source under an MIT license. No restrictions, no usage caps, no strings
          attached.
        </p>

        <p>
          The numbers on V4 Pro are staggering. 1.6 trillion total parameters with 49 billion active
          per token (mixture of experts architecture), trained on 33 trillion tokens. It ships with a
          1 million token context window built in from day one, not bolted on as an afterthought.
          SWE-bench Verified comes in at 80.6%, which puts it within 0.2 points of Claude Opus 4.6.
          That is frontier territory for an open source model.
        </p>

        <p>
          And the pricing. V4 Flash runs $0.14 per million input tokens and $0.28 per million output
          tokens. V4 Pro, the model that nearly matches Opus on coding benchmarks, costs $1.74/$3.48.
          Compare that to GPT-5.5 at $5/$30. DeepSeek&apos;s own technical report candidly admits they
          trail the absolute frontier by three to six months. But when your model costs a fraction of
          the closed alternatives, that gap barely matters for the vast majority of real-world
          applications.
        </p>

        <p>
          The open source AI community has been saying for two years that the gap would close. This
          week it did.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-text-primary pt-4">SpaceX Acquires xAI for $250 Billion</h2>

        <p>
          Elon Musk consolidated. SpaceX completed its acquisition of xAI for $250 billion, making it
          the largest AI acquisition in history by a wide margin. The Grok model family now has
          SpaceX&apos;s compute infrastructure behind it, which includes the massive Colossus
          supercomputer cluster that was already one of the largest training setups in the world.
        </p>

        <p>
          The strategic logic is straightforward. xAI was burning cash on compute. SpaceX has the
          capital and the infrastructure. Grok gets access to resources that would have taken xAI years
          to build independently, and SpaceX gets an in-house AI lab without starting from scratch.
          Musk has been open about wanting to integrate advanced AI into SpaceX&apos;s operations, from
          autonomous landing systems to satellite constellation management.
        </p>

        <p>
          What this means for the broader market is harder to predict. A quarter-trillion dollar
          valuation for an AI lab sets a new ceiling for the entire sector. It also raises questions
          about the concentration of AI capability within a small number of extremely well-funded
          organizations. We are entering a phase where building a frontier model requires resources
          that only a handful of companies on Earth can provide.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-text-primary pt-4">Claude Mythos 5 Triggers ASL-4</h2>

        <p>
          This one is different from the others. Anthropic confirmed that Claude Mythos 5 is a
          10-trillion parameter model. It is, by a significant margin, the largest model any major lab
          has acknowledged building.
        </p>

        <p>
          It will not be released publicly. It will not be available via API. Mythos 5 triggered
          Anthropic&apos;s ASL-4 safety protocol, which is reserved for models approaching genuinely
          dangerous capability thresholds. Internal testing only. This is the first time a major AI lab
          has built a model and publicly said: &quot;No. This one stays locked.&quot;
        </p>

        <p>
          Anthropic has been building toward this moment since they published their Responsible Scaling
          Policy. ASL-4 was always the level where the rules changed, where capabilities crossed from
          &quot;potentially harmful if misused&quot; to &quot;categorically dangerous without
          containment.&quot; That line has now been crossed. What Mythos 5 can actually do remains
          classified. What we know is that Anthropic, a company that sells access to AI models for a
          living, looked at this one and decided the risk outweighed the revenue.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-text-primary pt-4">Other Stories Worth Watching</h2>

        <p>
          Google announced a new family of AI inference chips designed to challenge NVIDIA&apos;s
          dominance in the data center. Details are thin, but the timing is intentional. NVIDIA
          controls roughly 80% of the AI accelerator market, and Google clearly intends to offer its
          cloud customers an alternative that does not depend on a single supplier.
        </p>

        <p>
          Novo Nordisk announced a partnership with OpenAI to apply large language models to drug
          discovery. The pharmaceutical giant is using GPT-5.5 to analyze protein folding data and
          identify potential drug candidates for metabolic diseases. This is one of the first major
          pharmaceutical partnerships built around a frontier model rather than a specialized
          scientific AI.
        </p>

        <p>
          NVIDIA unveiled Ising, a new platform for quantum computing acceleration. It is designed to
          bridge classical GPU compute with quantum processors, allowing researchers to run hybrid
          workloads without completely retooling their infrastructure. Early benchmarks suggest it
          reduces quantum simulation times by an order of magnitude on certain problem classes.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-text-primary pt-4">The Week in Perspective</h2>

        <p>
          Six months ago, a week like this would have been spread across an entire quarter. GPT-5.5
          alone would have dominated the news cycle for two weeks. Instead it shared the spotlight with
          an open source model that nearly matches it, an acquisition that dwarfs anything the industry
          has seen, and a safety decision that may define how we think about AI governance for years to
          come.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is what acceleration looks like. Not a single dramatic moment, but a week where five or
          six of them pile up and each one would have been the story of the month in 2024. The pace is
          not slowing down. If anything, the concentration of talent, capital, and compute in a
          shrinking number of organizations means it is speeding up.
