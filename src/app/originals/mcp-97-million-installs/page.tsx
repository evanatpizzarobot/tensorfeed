          When Anthropic first released the Model Context Protocol in late 2024, I thought it was
          interesting but niche. A tool-calling standard for Claude. Useful for power users, maybe.
          Probably wouldn&apos;t get broad adoption outside the Anthropic ecosystem.
        </p>

        <p>
          I was completely wrong.
        </p>

        <p>
          MCP just crossed 97 million installs across its ecosystem of packages. OpenAI added MCP support
          in the Agents SDK. Google integrated it into Gemini&apos;s tool use pipeline. Microsoft baked it
          into Copilot and VS Code. Cursor, Windsurf, Cline, Zed. Every major coding tool now speaks MCP.
          What started as one company&apos;s open-source experiment became the TCP/IP of the agent era.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-text-primary pt-4">Why MCP Won</h2>

        <p>
          There were other contenders. OpenAI had their function-calling spec. Google had their tool
          declaration format. Every provider had their own way of letting models interact with external
          systems. So why did MCP become the standard?
        </p>

        <p>
          Three reasons, as far as I can tell.
        </p>

        <p>
          First, it was open from day one. Apache 2.0 license, public spec, reference implementations in
          TypeScript and Python. No vendor lock-in, no licensing games, no trademark restrictions on the
          protocol name. When you bet on MCP, you&apos;re betting on an open standard, not a company.
        </p>

        <p>
          Second, it solved a real problem that developers felt every day. Before MCP, connecting an AI
          model to external tools meant writing custom integration code for each model and each tool. If
          you had 5 tools and wanted to support 3 models, that&apos;s 15 integration paths. MCP collapsed
          that to 5 servers and 3 clients. The math speaks for itself.
        </p>

        <p>
          Third, Anthropic shipped Claude Code. Millions of developers experienced MCP firsthand through
          Claude Code&apos;s tool use, and the quality of that experience created organic demand. When
          developers saw how cleanly MCP handled database connections, file system access, and API calls in
          Claude Code, they wanted the same thing in their own applications.
        </p>

        <p>
          There are MCP servers for everything you can think of. Databases (Postgres, MySQL, MongoDB),
          cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure), developer tools (GitHub, Jira, Linear), communication
          platforms (Slack, Discord), file storage, web scraping, you name it. The long tail is filling in
          fast.
        </p>

        <p>
          We track the most notable agents and frameworks on our{' '}
          <Link href="/agents" className="text-accent-primary hover:underline">agents directory</Link>, and
          MCP support has become a baseline expectation. If a new agent framework launches without MCP
          support, developers ask why.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-text-primary pt-4">What This Means for Developers</h2>

        <p>
          If you&apos;re building anything that involves AI interacting with external systems, you should
          be thinking about MCP. Here&apos;s the practical breakdown.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span className="text-text-primary font-medium">If you maintain a SaaS product:</span> Build an
          MCP server. It&apos;s the fastest path to making your product accessible to the entire AI agent
          ecosystem. One integration, every model.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span className="text-text-primary font-medium">If you&apos;re building an AI application:</span> Use
          MCP clients to connect to tools instead of writing custom integrations. Your users will thank
          you when they can plug in their existing MCP servers.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span className="text-text-primary font-medium">If you&apos;re a solo developer:</span> Start
          with a{' '}
          <Link href="/claude-md-guide" className="text-accent-primary hover:underline">CLAUDE.md file</Link> in
          your repos and experiment with MCP servers in Claude Code or your editor of choice. The learning
          curve is gentle and the productivity gains are immediate.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-text-primary pt-4">The Agent Era Is Not Coming. It&apos;s Here.</h2>

        <p>
          I keep hearing people talk about the &quot;coming agent era&quot; as if it&apos;s some future
          state we&apos;re building toward. Look at the numbers. 97 million installs. 12,000+ servers.
          Every major provider on board. This isn&apos;t a prediction about the future. This is a
          description of right now.
        </p>

        <p>
          Every day, I see agent traffic in the TensorFeed logs. Bots pulling our{' '}
          <Link href="/developers" className="text-accent-primary hover:underline">JSON API</Link>, reading
          our llms.txt, consuming our feeds. It&apos;s still a small percentage of total traffic, but
          it&apos;s growing every week. And these aren&apos;t dumb crawlers. They&apos;re agents doing
          real work on behalf of real users.
        </p>

        <p>
          MCP is the protocol that made this possible. It gave agents a universal language for interacting
          with tools. And now that the language exists, the agents are showing up everywhere.
        </p>
