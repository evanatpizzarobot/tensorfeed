          Everyone has access to AI now. ChatGPT is free. Claude has a free tier. Gemini comes bundled with every Google account. Open source models run on laptops. The tools are everywhere. So why is the economic value landing in the same small group of companies?
        </p>

        <p>
          PwC just published its 2026 AI Performance Study, surveying 1,217 senior executives across 25 sectors and multiple regions. The headline finding: 74% of all AI-driven economic gains are captured by just 20% of organizations. The other 80% are stuck splitting the remaining quarter.
        </p>

        <p>
          That is not a rounding error. That is a structural divide, and it is getting wider.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-text-primary pt-4">The 7.2x Gap</h2>

        <p>
          PwC measured AI-driven performance as the revenue and efficiency gains attributable to AI, adjusted against industry medians. The top-performing 20% of companies are generating 7.2 times more AI-driven revenue and efficiency gains than the average competitor.
        </p>

        <p>
          Seven times. Not 20% more. Not double. Seven times.
        </p>

        <p>
          And the gap is not about budget. It is not that the leaders are spending more on compute or hiring more ML engineers. According to the study, the difference comes down to three things: how companies use AI for growth (not just cost-cutting), how they handle data governance, and how quickly they are willing to let AI make decisions without a human in the loop.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-text-primary pt-4">Growth vs. Productivity: The Real Split</h2>

        <p>
          Most companies treat AI as a productivity tool. Automate reports. Summarize emails. Generate boilerplate code. That saves time, and time savings are real. But the companies capturing the most value are doing something different: they are using AI to create new revenue streams.
        </p>

        <p>
          The PwC study found that leaders are focused on growth, not just productivity. They are building AI-native products. They are entering adjacent markets enabled by AI capabilities they did not have before. They are using AI to converge industries, finding opportunities at the intersection of sectors that used to be separate.
        </p>

        <p>
          A concrete example: Instacart co-founder Apoorva Mehta just launched Abundance, a hedge fund designed to have AI agents run the entire operation, with $100 million in seed funding. That is not a productivity play. That is a new business built on the assumption that AI agents can replace human fund managers.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-text-primary pt-4">The Autonomy Factor</h2>

        <p>
          Here is the number that surprised me most. AI leaders are increasing the number of decisions made without human intervention at 2.8 times the rate of their peers.
        </p>

        <p>
          That means the top companies are not just deploying AI. They are trusting it. They are letting agents handle procurement decisions, customer routing, inventory optimization, and pricing adjustments without a human approving every action. The rest of the market is still running AI as a suggestion engine, where a human reviews and clicks approve before anything happens.
        </p>

        <p>
          The speed difference compounds. If your AI agent can make 50 decisions per hour autonomously while your competitor&apos;s AI generates 50 recommendations that sit in someone&apos;s inbox, you move faster in every dimension.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-text-primary pt-4">Where the Capital Is Going</h2>

        <p>
          The investment side of AI tells the same story. This week alone, Amazon committed up to $25 billion in additional funding to Anthropic, on top of the $8 billion already invested. That deal includes Anthropic committing to spend over $100 billion on AWS infrastructure over the next decade, including nearly 1 gigawatt of Trainium2 and Trainium3 capacity coming online by year end.
        </p>

        <p>
          Amazon also invested $50 billion in OpenAI just two months earlier. Google has committed up to $40 billion in Anthropic. The money is flowing to the companies building the models, and the companies building the models are signing infrastructure deals that lock in cloud revenue for a decade.

            </tbody>
          </table>
        </div>

        <p>
          The pattern is clear. Big tech is not hedging. They are going all in, and they are going in on multiple fronts simultaneously. Amazon alone has committed $83 billion across OpenAI and Anthropic.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-text-primary pt-4">What the Laggards Are Getting Wrong</h2>

        <p>
          If you are in the 80%, PwC&apos;s data points to three common failure modes.
        </p>

        <p>
          First, pilot purgatory. Companies run a proof of concept, it works, and then it sits there. Nobody champions it into production. Nobody rewires the business process around it. The demo works, but the org does not change.
        </p>

        <p>
          Second, treating AI as a feature instead of a foundation. Bolting a chatbot onto a legacy product is not an AI strategy. The leaders are rebuilding products with AI at the core, not stapling it to the side.
        </p>

        <p>
          Third, data problems. Not having enough data or having the wrong data, but having data that is siloed, ungoverned, and inaccessible to the AI systems that need it. The leaders invested in data infrastructure before they invested in models. The laggards are trying to do it backwards.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-text-primary pt-4">What This Means for Developers</h2>

        <p>
          For individual developers and small teams, the PwC study carries a counterintuitive message. The tools have never been cheaper or more accessible. API pricing dropped 70% to 90% across the board last year. Open source models like DeepSeek V4 deliver near-frontier performance under an MIT license. You can build an AI agent for the cost of a coffee.
        </p>

        <p>
          The bottleneck is not access to AI. It is the willingness to build around it instead of on top of it. The 20% are not using better models. They are building different businesses.
        </p>

        <p>
          That is actually good news if you are starting fresh. You do not need a $25 billion infrastructure deal. You need a product where AI is the product, not a feature of the product. The companies capturing the most value right now are the ones that could not exist without AI. The ones capturing the least are the ones that would look roughly the same with or without it.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-text-primary pt-4">The Uncomfortable Question</h2>

        <p>
          PwC&apos;s data suggests the divide will keep widening. The leaders are compounding their advantage. More autonomous decisions means more data means better models means more autonomous decisions. The feedback loop favors whoever starts first and moves fastest.
        </p>

        <p>
          If 74% of the value is going to 20% of companies today, what does the split look like in two years? If the leaders are automating decisions at 2.8x the rate, does the gap close, or does it become permanent?
        </p>

        <p>
          I think the answer depends on the next wave of AI tooling. If the agent frameworks get good enough, fast enough, smaller companies can leapfrog the incumbents entirely. You do not need to be in the top 20% if you can build from scratch without the organizational baggage. The question is whether the infrastructure moats (the hundred-billion-dollar cloud deals, the gigawatt data centers, the exclusive model partnerships) make that leapfrog impossible.
        </p>

        <p>
          We will keep tracking the data. The numbers do not lie, even when they are uncomfortable.
