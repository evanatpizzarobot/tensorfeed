          Stanford released the 2026 AI Index report, and the headline is damning: AI is sprinting, and we are struggling to keep up. Not just in research. In policy. In regulation. In the ability of human institutions to respond to what is actually happening in the labs.
        </p>

        <p>
          Reading the report, I kept coming back to one number. The gap between the rate of capability growth and the rate of policy creation is widening, not narrowing. And everyone seems to know this is happening except the people who could do something about it.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-text-primary pt-4">The Capability Landscape</h2>

        <p>
          Here is what the Stanford index found about the current state of frontier models as of March 2026.
        </p>

        <p>
          Anthropic is leading. Claude models, across the product line from Haiku to Opus to Mythos, are setting the performance baseline for most benchmarks. The company is shipping the most capable general-purpose model available. They are also shipping the most thoughtful safety evaluations.
        </p>

        <p>
          xAI is second. Grok has closed the gap on reasoning tasks. Elon Musk&apos;s company has invested heavily in compute and is getting returns. xAI is not the leader, but the distance between first and second has shrunk dramatically in the past year.
        </p>

        <p>
          Google is third with Gemini. Incredibly capable on multi-modal tasks. Gemini 2.5 Pro handles documents, images, and video better than competitors. The weakness is reasoning on pure text benchmarks where Claude still leads. But Google is not losing ground. They are competing hard on usability and feature integration, which matters more to regular users than benchmark points.
        </p>

        <p>
          OpenAI is fourth with ChatGPT-4o. This surprises people until you understand the metric. OpenAI is shipping smarter products that win on deployment and scale. But on raw capability benchmarks, they are being out-innovated right now by Anthropic and xAI. This will probably not last. OpenAI has enormous resources and talented researchers. But in this moment, the momentum is elsewhere.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-text-primary pt-4">The Policy Problem</h2>

        <p>
          Here is where the Stanford Index stops being optimistic.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the US, policy response to frontier AI has been sporadic. Some states pass bills. Some get vetoed. The federal government gestures toward regulation without committing to anything specific. Meanwhile, companies are shipping more capable models at an accelerating pace.
        </p>

        <p>
          Europe went further with the AI Act. But even the EU governance framework is playing catch-up. The rules written in 2023 assume a world where the bottleneck is compute. In 2026, the bottleneck is human judgment about what to do with the compute we already have.
        </p>

        <p>
          California tried to pass meaningful legislation. Senate Bill 53 got enacted in April 2026, requiring AI model developers to disclose safety practices and establish whistleblower protections. That is good. It is also insufficient.
        </p>

        <p>
          SB 53 creates requirements. It does not create enforcement mechanisms. It does not create a clear regulatory body. It does not define what safety disclosure actually means or how it will be verified. It is a framework for a framework. Necessary but not sufficient.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-text-primary pt-4">The Investment Boom</h2>

        <p>
          The Stanford Index documents something else worth understanding: the investment boom in AI shows no signs of slowing.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 2025, venture capital funding for AI startups exceeded $45 billion. In 2026, that number is on track to increase. Most of this money flows to applications and enterprise tooling. But a meaningful portion goes to companies trying to build frontier models.
        </p>

        <p>
          This creates a perverse incentive. If you are a founder trying to raise money, the winning strategy is to train a model that is visibly more capable than last quarter&apos;s model. You make safety trade-offs that are defensible in the short term but problematic in the long term. You move fast and break things, which includes potentially breaking things about AI safety.
        </p>

        <p>
          Anthropic is the exception. They have explicitly raised money on the basis of doing safety seriously. xAI is building rapidly but with thoughtfulness about testing. But for every Anthropic, there are ten startups competing on speed. The market rewards speed. Policy has not yet created a reason to reward safety instead.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-text-primary pt-4">What The Numbers Tell Us</h2>

        <p>
          The Stanford Index compiles a lot of data. Let me give you the key metrics that actually matter.
        </p>

        <p>
          Since 2024, the number of papers published on foundation models has grown 35 percent. The number of papers that include safety and security analysis has grown 12 percent. The gap is widening. More capability research. Less safety research. That is the wrong direction.
        </p>

        <p>
          Compute spending on training has increased 60 percent year over year. Policy funding has not increased proportionally. Governance institutions are not growing. The disparity is unsustainable. Eventually, it will correct. The question is how.
        </p>

        <p>
          Model release cadence has accelerated. New frontier models are shipping every 2 to 3 months instead of 6 to 9 months. This is good for progress and competition. It is bad for safety evaluation, which takes time.
        </p>

        <p>
          Companies are getting better at red-teaming and internal safety evaluations. That is excellent and unexpected. But external evaluation is lagging. Independent researchers have less access to frontier models. The public knows less about what these systems can actually do.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-text-primary pt-4">The Fundamental Question</h2>

        <p>
          The Stanford AI Index is essentially asking a question that nobody wants to answer directly: what do we do when AI capability is growing faster than our ability to govern it?
        </p>

        <p>
          The pessimistic answer is that we get surprised. Something goes wrong. A model is used in a way nobody intended. Society reacts with panic. We get draconian, counterproductive regulation. Innovation slows. Everyone loses.
        </p>

        <p>
          The optimistic answer is that companies continue to police themselves at a level above what regulation would require. Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google invest in safety and transparency beyond shareholder pressure. Governance structures emerge. We muddle through.
        </p>

        <p>
          The realistic answer is probably somewhere in between. We will get some good policies. We will miss some risks. We will move slower than ideal. But we will not crash. We will iterate. And by 2030, the AI governance landscape will look different from now.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Stanford Index is not saying we are doomed. It is saying we are behind. The difference matters.
