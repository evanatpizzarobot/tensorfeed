          Yesterday afternoon, while the Western AI press was still digesting GPT-5.5, a Chinese
          quant fund&apos;s research lab quietly uploaded 1.6 trillion parameters to Hugging Face
          under an MIT license. DeepSeek V4 is here. Twenty-four hours of community testing later,
          one thing is clear: this is the first time an open weight model has actually caught the
          frontier, and the gap between open and closed has effectively collapsed for most production
          workloads.
        </p>

        <p>
          I&apos;ve spent the morning running V4 through our pricing pipeline, comparing benchmark
          submissions, and reading the technical report. The pricing alone would have been the
          headline. But the architectural work underneath might be more important.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-text-primary pt-4">What Actually Shipped</h2>

        <p>
          DeepSeek V4 is a two model family. V4-Pro is the flagship at 1.6 trillion total parameters
          with 49 billion active per token, pre-trained on 33 trillion tokens. V4-Flash is a smaller
          sibling at 284 billion total and 13 billion active, trained on 32 trillion tokens. Both
          ship with a 1 million token context window and 384K maximum output. Both use Mixture of
          Experts architecture. Both are open source under MIT.
        </p>

        <p>
          The weights are on Hugging Face. The API went live at midnight UTC, supports both
          OpenAI ChatCompletions and Anthropic message formats, and is currently flagged as a
          preview release.
        </p>

        <p>
          The team also confirmed close integration with Huawei&apos;s new Ascend 950 inference
          chips. This is the part Western coverage keeps glossing over. DeepSeek is no longer
          dependent on Nvidia for inference on its own platform. That decoupling is a story all
          by itself.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-text-primary pt-4">The Pricing Is Not A Typo</h2>

        <p>
          Here is the table that has been making the rounds since launch. I rebuilt it with our
          own numbers and added the relevant Western frontier comparisons.

        <p>
          V4 Pro output tokens cost $3.48 per million. GPT-5.5 output tokens cost $30. That is
          roughly an 8.6x gap on output and a 2.9x gap on input, before we even account for the
          fact that the V4 weights are downloadable and self hostable. If you want to skip the
          DeepSeek API entirely and run on your own GPUs, you can. The license permits it.
        </p>

        <p>
          V4 Flash is more interesting still. At $0.14 in and $0.28 out, this is frontier-class
          performance at chatbot pricing. The closest analog from a US lab is GPT-4o Mini at $0.15
          in and $0.60 out. Flash is cheaper than that and probably more capable.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-text-primary pt-4">The Benchmarks Are Closer Than I Expected</h2>

        <p>
          DeepSeek released V4 Pro&apos;s benchmark numbers alongside the model card. Independent

        </div>

        <p>
          80.6% on SWE-bench Verified is the number that matters. That is the gold standard for
          real-world coding agents, and V4 Pro is essentially tied with Claude Opus 4.6, the model
          that anchored the high end of the agentic coding market for most of last year. Opus 4.7
          and GPT-5.5 are still ahead, but the gap is now small enough to call a tie for many
          production workloads.
        </p>

        <p>
          The 3,206 Codeforces rating is the kind of competitive programming result that used to
          require a frontier closed model. Ranking 23rd among human competitors is not a marginal
          score. It is genuinely strong.
        </p>

        <p>
          The FrontierMath number is the only soft spot. 22.1% is well below GPT-5.5&apos;s 35.4%,
          which I covered{' '}
          <Link href="/originals/gpt-5-5-openai-flagship" className="text-accent-primary hover:underline">
            in yesterday&apos;s GPT-5.5 piece
          </Link>
          . Frontier mathematics still favors the labs with the deepest reasoning training pipelines.
          That gap will close eventually, but for now, if your application is dominated by hard math,
          GPT-5.5 is still the right model.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-text-primary pt-4">The Architecture Story Is The Real News</h2>

        <p>
          Pricing wars get the headlines, but the technical paper is where this gets interesting.
          DeepSeek introduced what they call Hybrid Attention Architecture, a routing scheme that
          mixes traditional dense attention with a learned sparse retrieval layer. The claim is that
          at 1M token context, V4 Pro requires only 27% of the per-token inference FLOPs and 10% of
          the KV cache footprint of V3.2.
        </p>

        <p>
          That is not a small optimization. Long context inference cost has been the main reason
          frontier labs charge a premium for million token windows. If V4 Pro genuinely runs 1M
          context at a tenth of the memory cost of last year&apos;s architecture, it changes the
          economics of long context applications. Codebase ingestion, multi-document reasoning,
          and agent loops with extensive tool history all become significantly cheaper to run.
        </p>

        <p>
          For self hosting, this matters even more. A model whose 1M context fits comfortably on
          a small cluster of H200s or Ascend 950s is fundamentally different from a model that
          requires a small data center to serve. DeepSeek published serving cost estimates of
          around $0.40 per million input tokens at typical utilization on Ascend hardware. That
          is the floor.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-text-primary pt-4">What Closed Labs Have To Say About It</h2>

        <p>
          OpenAI launched GPT-5.5 two days ago at double the price of GPT-5.4. The pitch was that
          frontier capability deserves a premium. That pitch held up for about 36 hours before
          DeepSeek essentially undercut the entire frontier on the same day. GPT-5.5 still wins on
          FrontierMath and Terminal-Bench, but the price gap is now 8 to 10x for tasks where V4 Pro
          is roughly equivalent. Many enterprise buyers will not pay that gap.
        </p>

        <p>
          Anthropic is in a more complicated spot. Opus 4.7 is the most expensive proprietary model
          on the market at $15 in and $75 out. The pitch has been deep reasoning on agent workflows
          and code. V4 Pro just matched Opus 4.6 on SWE-bench Verified at a 23rd of the output cost.
          The Opus tier needs a clearer differentiation story than it has today, and Mythos cannot
          be that story for paying customers because it is gated.
        </p>

        <p>
          Google&apos;s Gemini 3.1 Pro is actually fine. The 2M context window is still unmatched,
          and Gemini Flash is competitive with V4 Flash at the budget end. Google was always playing
          a different game on price. They are mostly insulated from this release.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-text-primary pt-4">What This Means If You&apos;re Building</h2>

        <p>
          For new applications, V4 Flash is now the default starting point for prototyping anything
          that does not require the absolute frontier. It is cheaper than the budget tier of every
          US lab, more capable, and the weights are downloadable if you ever want to leave the
          managed API. There is almost no reason to start a new project on GPT-4o Mini today.
        </p>

        <p>
          For production agentic coding applications, V4 Pro is now a serious option. Real benchmark
          parity with Claude Opus 4.6 at a fraction of the cost is a genuine offer. The risk is
          deployment maturity. The DeepSeek API is still labeled preview and has had two minor
          incidents in the last 24 hours according to our{' '}
          <Link href="/incidents" className="text-accent-primary hover:underline">incident log</Link>
          . If you need 99.9% uptime today, stick with the established providers and revisit V4 in
          six weeks.
        </p>

        <p>
          For anyone running self-hosted inference, this is an unambiguous upgrade path. The MIT
          license, the architectural efficiency gains, and the published serving cost guidance
          mean you can rebuild your inference stack on V4 weights with confidence. Several
          inference platforms (Together, Fireworks, Lepton) already announced V4 Pro endpoints
          this morning at sub $2 output pricing.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-text-primary pt-4">Our Take</h2>

        <p>
          For two years, the open source AI conversation has been about whether the gap to
          frontier closed models was closing fast enough to matter for real applications.
          DeepSeek V4 is the answer. The gap is closed for the workloads that account for
          most enterprise AI spend: code generation, agent loops, long context retrieval,
          and routine reasoning. The gap is still real, but only at the very top of the
          capability curve, where models like GPT-5.5 and Claude Mythos still hold a clear
          lead.
        </p>

        <p>
          The pricing implications are going to ripple for months. Closed labs will have to
          either justify their premium with capabilities V4 cannot match, drop prices into
          the V4 range, or accept that the floor of the frontier is now open source. None
          of those options are easy. We covered the broader pricing trajectory in{' '}
          <Link href="/originals/ai-pricing-floor" className="text-accent-primary hover:underline">
            our pricing floor analysis
          </Link>{' '}
          two weeks ago. V4 just yanked that floor down another notch.
        </p>

        <p>
          We are adding both V4 models to our{' '}
          <Link href="/models" className="text-accent-primary hover:underline">models tracker</Link> and{' '}
          <Link href="/tools/cost-calculator" className="text-accent-primary hover:underline">cost calculator</Link>{' '}
          today. We will run our own SWE-bench Verified reproduction over the weekend and update
          the page with results. Independent benchmark verification is what matters, and the next
          two weeks of community testing will tell us whether the released numbers hold under
          adversarial conditions.
        </p>

        <p>
          One last thought: a year ago, DeepSeek R1 was a surprise. Today, V4 is an expected move
          from a lab that has earned its reputation. The next surprise is probably Mistral, Qwen,
          or a lab nobody is watching yet. The frontier is no longer a closed club.
