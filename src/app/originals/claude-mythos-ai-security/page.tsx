          Cybersecurity professionals have a saying: a good defense requires you to think like an attacker. Claude Mythos does not just think like an attacker. It builds attacks that take security teams weeks to conceive, and compresses the work into hours. The implications are rewriting the conversation about AI and cybersecurity in real time.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-text-primary pt-4">What the Evals Showed</h2>

        <p>
          The UK AI Security Institute tested Mythos in a series of capture-the-flag scenarios designed to mirror real attack conditions. These are not theoretical exercises. They are practical security challenges where the goal is concrete: breach the target system, capture the flag, prove it, exit cleanly.
        </p>

        <p>
          In those scenarios, Mythos demonstrated something new. It did not just answer security questions. It performed reconnaissance, identified attack chains, and executed multi-stage exploits with minimal guidance. When a target had multiple vulnerabilities, Mythos often figured out how to chain them together in unexpected ways. It found subtle logical flaws that humans had designed into systems intentionally to test defensive thinking.
        </p>

        <p>
          It succeeded more often than previous models. By a large margin. That is the headline.
        </p>

        <p>
          But the more interesting finding is not success rate. It is speed. Work that a skilled security professional would spend two weeks planning, documenting, and executing, Mythos completed in hours. Not because it was taking shortcuts. Because it was thinking faster and broader than humans do.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-text-primary pt-4">Autonomous Exploit Generation</h2>

        <p>
          The most technically impressive capability is autonomous exploit generation. Take a complex vulnerability. Describe what the system should do and what it actually does. Mythos figures out how to write code that exploits the gap between intention and implementation.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is not a trivial thing. Exploit writing requires understanding low-level systems, memory layouts, compiler behavior, assembly language, and dozens of other technical details. It requires the ability to reason about what will work before actually running the code, because sometimes running the wrong thing crashes your test target.
        </p>

        <p>
          Mythos does this. Autonomously. On the first attempt, often successfully. When it needs to iterate, it learns from failure and adapts. When it encounters a variant, it generalizes.
        </p>

        <p>
          This matters because exploit writing has been a bottleneck in both offense and defense. Defenders want to find and patch vulnerabilities before attackers can weaponize them. But exploit development takes time, skill, and expensive talent. Mythos collapses that timeline.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-text-primary pt-4">What This Changes</h2>

        <p>
          For defenders, the immediate implication is grim. If a vulnerability exists, Mythos can find it and build a working exploit faster than teams can patch. The strategy has to shift from a race of patch speed to reduction of attack surface.
        </p>

        <p>
          But there is a counterintuitive opportunity here. The same model that can find and exploit vulnerabilities can also find and patch them. Better yet, it can do this at scale. A single instance of Mythos pointed at your codebase could theoretically audit your entire architecture, identify weaknesses, and propose fixes faster than a team of humans could scope the work.
        </p>

        <p>
          That is the defense application. And it is why Anthropic chose to give Mythos to defender organizations first.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-text-primary pt-4">The Asymmetry Problem</h2>

        <p>
          Here is the uncomfortable truth beneath these evaluations: Mythos is both a tool and a threat. It can secure critical infrastructure or compromise it depending on whose hands it is in. That is not new for technology. But the degree of asymmetry is new.
        </p>

        <p>
          A skilled attacker with Mythos is orders of magnitude more effective than a skilled attacker without it. A defender with Mythos is also orders of magnitude more effective. But defenders move slowly due to risk aversion, process, and bureaucracy. Attackers move fast.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is why Anthropic insisted on giving Mythos to defenders first. Not because it will permanently prevent attacks. But because it buys time. The defenders get a runway of six to eighteen months where they have Mythos-equivalent capabilities and attackers do not.
        </p>

        <p>
          Use that time to harden systems. Find vulnerabilities before Mythos-equipped attackers do. Build defenses that work at the speed of AI.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-text-primary pt-4">The Bigger Conversation</h2>

        <p>
          Every security professional I know is wrestling with the same question: what does cybersecurity even look like when AI can think faster and reason better than humans? When the bottleneck is no longer human skill, but compute availability?
        </p>

        <p>
          The answer is that security becomes a different discipline. You cannot defend through obscurity. You cannot rely on defenders being smarter than attackers. You have to design systems where the majority of attack vectors simply do not exist. You have to assume breach and design for containment. You have to treat security as a solved problem where the parameters are mathematical rather than intuitive.
        </p>

        <p>
          Mythos is forcing that conversation forward. Not because it is evil. Because it is honest. It shows us what AI can actually do when applied to the hardest adversarial problems. Then it hands the tool to the people whose job is to defend against it.
        </p>

        <p>
          That is either the smartest or the most reckless thing Anthropic has done. Possibly both. And the cybersecurity world is going to be figuring out which for the next few years.
