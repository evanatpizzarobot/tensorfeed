          One engineer is reportedly worth $1.5 billion to Meta. Another labs CTO walked out of OpenAI
          last Friday. Venture capitalists have already poured $18.8 billion into AI startups
          founded since the start of 2025. We are watching the most expensive labor reshuffle in
          the history of technology, and it is happening in real time.
        </p>

        <p>
          CNBC ran a piece this morning on the talent exodus from Big Tech to AI startups, and the
          numbers in it are worth pausing on. The story is no longer about a few high-profile
          departures. It is about a structural redistribution of who gets to build frontier models,
          and what it costs to keep them.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-text-primary pt-4">The Headline Number</h2>

        <p>
          The most-quoted figure this week is Andrew Tulloch&apos;s reported $1.5 billion package
          from Meta, paid out over six years. Tulloch was a co-founder of Thinking Machines Lab, the
          startup Mira Murati launched after leaving OpenAI. Meta hired five of its founding members
          after Murati turned down a reported $1 billion buyout offer from Zuckerberg.
        </p>

        <p>
          $1.5 billion for one person is not a salary. It is an acquisition price for a single
          neuron in the org chart. If the numbers are accurate, it is the most expensive individual
          talent hire in the history of the technology industry. NBA superstars do not get paid
          this. Hedge fund partners do not get paid this. We are now in a regime where one
          frontier-model engineer is priced like a mid-cap acquisition.
        </p>

        <p>
          To put it on a chart, here is how the top reported AI hires of the last twelve months stack
          up against historical reference points.

        <p>
          A $1.5B package over six years works out to about $250 million per year, before accounting
          for vesting cliffs, RSU price assumptions, and clawbacks. Even on a conservative read, it
          is more than 14x what a top S&amp;P 500 chief executive earns. Meta is betting that the
          right neural net architect produces more shareholder value than a Fortune 500 CEO. That is
          either a sensible read of where AI is heading, or one of the more remarkable mispricings
          we will see this decade.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-text-primary pt-4">The Founders Are Voting With Their Feet</h2>

        <p>
          The flow is not all one direction. While Meta vacuums up Thinking Machines, the founder
          class at every major lab is heading the other way. They are walking out the door with
          their reputations, their networks, and a check in their hand before the laptop is
          returned.
        </p>

        <p>
          Three OpenAI departures in ten days are worth flagging. On April 18, Kevin Weil, formerly
          Chief Product Officer and most recently head of OpenAI for Science, posted his farewell.
          Bill Peebles, who built Sora from the ground up, said his goodbyes the same week.
          Srinivas Narayanan, CTO of enterprise applications, announced he was stepping away. Three
          senior leaders, all in the space of a few business days. None of them have publicly named
          their next move, which usually means a stealth-mode startup with funding already in place.
        </p>

        <p>
          xAI is in a different category. By late March 2026, all 11 of the original xAI
          co-founders had departed, with the final two leaving days apart. More than 80 researchers
          and engineers have exited in the months since. SpaceX&apos;s $250 billion absorption of xAI
          earlier this month, which we covered in our{' '}
          <Link href="/originals/ai-week-april-24-2026" className="text-accent-primary hover:underline">weekly roundup</Link>,
          looks more and more like a structural rescue than a strategic acquisition. When the
          original team has voted unanimously to walk, the value left in the building is the
          compute, not the cap table.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-text-primary pt-4">Where the Money Is Following</h2>

        <p>
          Capital is following the talent, not the other way around. According to Dealroom data
          cited in the CNBC reporting, VCs have funneled $18.8 billion into AI startups founded
          since the start of 2025 in just the first quarter and change of 2026. That is on a pace
          to surpass the $27.9 billion raised by AI startups born in that cohort during 2025
          itself.
        </p>

        <p>
          The pattern is consistent: well-known operator leaves a frontier lab, raises a Series A
          (or skips straight to a $2 billion seed at a $12 billion valuation, in Murati&apos;s
          case), recruits a small core team, and is immediately re-targeted by Big Tech for either
          acquisition or talent raid. The cycle compresses every quarter. Thinking Machines went
          from founding to $50 billion talks to having half its founders extracted to Meta in less
          than nine months.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-text-primary pt-4">What This Means for the Model Pipeline</h2>

        <p>
          This is the part that matters for anyone tracking model releases. The talent flow is
          shaping which labs will ship in 2027 and which will not.

        </p>

        <p>
          Meta is consolidating. By absorbing Wang, Friedman, and the Thinking Machines core, they
          are buying the executive layer for a model push that has not yet shipped publicly. We
          should expect a major Llama-class release before the end of the year that reflects this
          new team&apos;s influence. Whether that release lives up to a $14 billion talent budget is
          a different question.
        </p>

        <p>
          OpenAI is in an interesting position. They just shipped GPT-5.5, which we covered{' '}
          <Link href="/originals/gpt-5-5-openai-flagship" className="text-accent-primary hover:underline">last week</Link>,
          and the benchmark scores are genuinely strong. But they are bleeding the operators who
          built the surrounding product surface area. Sora&apos;s creator is gone. Enterprise
          applications CTO is gone. The science org head is gone. The model is excellent. The
          organization is reorganizing in flight.
        </p>

        <p>
          Anthropic is the dark horse. Annualized revenue ran from $1 billion at end of 2024 to
          $9 billion at end of 2025 to $30 billion as of early April 2026. They have not had a
          public talent crisis. The recent Google compute deal, which we wrote up{' '}
          <Link href="/originals/google-anthropic-40b-compute" className="text-accent-primary hover:underline">earlier this week</Link>,
          gave them five gigawatts of TPU capacity over five years. Money plus compute plus a stable
          team is the rarest combination in the market right now.
        </p>

        <p>
          The bleeding edge is now Mira Murati and the dozen-or-so other ex-frontier-lab founders
          who are still on the field. If their startups can hit usable products before they get
          raided to pieces, the next model frontier will come from companies that did not exist 24
          months ago.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-text-primary pt-4">Our Take</h2>

        <p>
          $1.5 billion for one engineer is the kind of headline that sounds like a top-of-cycle
          signal. In a different market, it would be. In this one, the math is more defensible
          than it looks. If Meta&apos;s next flagship adds even a tenth of a point to the right
          benchmark and that translates into Reels watch-time or WhatsApp Business adoption, the
          payback period is short. The cost of being second is rising faster than the cost of any
          individual hire.
        </p>

        <p>
          What concerns us is the structural side. When the entire founding team of one major lab
          (xAI) walks, when three OpenAI senior leaders leave in ten days, when Thinking Machines
          loses half its founders inside a year, the signal is not that AI is overheated. The
          signal is that the human capital pool that knows how to actually train and ship a
          frontier model is small enough to fit on one floor of one office building, and the
          spreadsheets at every major lab know it.
        </p>

        <p>
          For developers and agent builders, the practical takeaway is to plan for a more turbulent
          model pipeline. Some labs will sprint, others will stall, and the ranking will shuffle.
          That is one reason we built the{' '}
          <Link href="/models" className="text-accent-primary hover:underline">live models tracker</Link> and the{' '}
          <Link href="/benchmarks" className="text-accent-primary hover:underline">benchmark page</Link>{' '}
          the way we did. The names at the top of the leaderboard in October will not be the same
          as the ones there now. The talent map says so.
        </p>

        <p>
          We will be watching where the next dozen ex-OpenAI, ex-DeepMind, ex-Anthropic founders
          land, and pricing the implications into our coverage as they show up.
        </p>
