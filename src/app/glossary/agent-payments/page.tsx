Their primitives (signup forms, 3DS challenges, webhook secrets, dashboard logins) all require human intervention. AI agents making decisions autonomously in a loop have none of those affordances.

      acceptedAnswer: { '@type': 'Answer', text: 'An agent discovers a paid endpoint (via x402 manifest, MCP registry, or hardcoded URL). It POSTs a request with no auth and receives HTTP 402 with payment instructions: wallet address, asset, network, amount. It signs and broadcasts a USDC transfer on-chain. It retries the request with the tx hash in a header. The server verifies the on-chain receipt and serves the data. Total round-trip: about 5 seconds the first time, sub-second per call after a bearer token mints.' },

      '@type': 'Question',
      name: 'What is the relationship between agent payments, x402, and MCP?',
      acceptedAnswer: { '@type': 'Answer', text: 'They compose. MCP is the discovery and tool-calling layer (how the agent finds and invokes APIs). x402 is the payment-required layer (how the API gates responses on payment). Agent payments is the resulting pattern: agents discover tools via MCP, pay via x402, settle on-chain. Each piece is independently useful, but together they form a complete agent commerce stack.' },

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-text-primary pt-2">The shift</h2>
        <p>
          For most of the internet&apos;s history, every paid API assumed a human at purchase time.
          A human filled out a signup form. A human attached a credit card. A human copy-pasted an
          API key into a config file. The whole stack of payment infrastructure (Stripe, PayPal,
          merchant accounts, processors) was designed around that assumption.
        </p>

        <p>
          AI agents do not have that. An agent making decisions in a loop does not have a credit
          card. It does not have a SaaS account. It does not have a human approving each
          transaction. The agent payments pattern fills the gap by removing the human entirely
          from the credential and authorization path.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-text-primary pt-2">The three primitives</h2>
        <ol className="space-y-2 list-decimal list-inside ml-4">
          <li><strong className="text-text-primary">Self-custodied agent wallets:</strong> the agent has its own private key and an on-chain address it controls. Funded by its developer or earned from parent agents paying it for tasks.</li>
          <li><strong className="text-text-primary">x402 payment-required HTTP:</strong> the API returns 402 with payment instructions. The agent retries with proof of payment. See{' '}
            <Link href="/glossary/x402" className="text-accent-primary hover:underline">x402</Link>{' '}
            for the full protocol.</li>
          <li><strong className="text-text-primary">Discovery via MCP and well-known manifests:</strong> agents find paid services via the official MCP registry, .well-known/x402 manifests, or hardcoded URLs. See{' '}
            <Link href="/glossary/mcp" className="text-accent-primary hover:underline">MCP</Link>.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-text-primary pt-2">Why on-chain settlement</h2>
        <p>The on-chain rail (typically USDC on Base, sometimes Solana) gives agent payments four properties traditional payment infra cannot match:</p>
        <ul className="space-y-2 list-disc list-inside ml-4">
          <li><strong className="text-text-primary">No accounts:</strong> wallets are first-class identities. The agent is the wallet.</li>
          <li><strong className="text-text-primary">No chargebacks:</strong> on-chain finality means once paid, the transaction is settled. No 60-day reversal window.</li>
          <li><strong className="text-text-primary">No platform risk:</strong> Stripe can decide tomorrow that AI agent transactions look fishy and freeze the merchant account. On-chain settlement has no such kill switch.</li>
          <li><strong className="text-text-primary">Microtransactions work:</strong> sub-cent gas fees on L2s like Base make $0.02 per call economically viable. Stripe&apos;s $0.30 + 2.9% per transaction cannot price that low.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-text-primary pt-2">A real example</h2>

        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-text-primary pt-2">The current state of the ecosystem</h2>
        <p>
          As of mid-2026, agent payments is early but real. Coinbase Developer Platform shipped{' '}
          <Link href="/glossary/x402" className="text-accent-primary hover:underline">x402</Link>{' '}
          V2 with discovery extensions. The official MCP registry has thousands of servers. Smithery,
          mcp.so, and other registries provide additional discovery paths. A handful of services
          (TensorFeed, PROWL, SkillMint, APIbase.pro, others) have shipped pay-per-call premium tiers.
          Coinbase&apos;s AgentKit and a few independent projects are working on agent wallet
          tooling.
        </p>

        <p>
          The bottleneck is on the buyer side: most AI agents do not yet have wallets. The frameworks
          most agents are built on (LangChain, LangGraph, CrewAI, Autogen, custom OpenAI/Anthropic
          SDKs) have no native wallet abstraction. That is changing, but slowly.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-text-primary pt-2">If you are building an agent that pays</h2>
        <p>
          The simplest path: use TensorFeed&apos;s Python SDK with the optional <code className="text-accent-primary font-mono">[web3]</code>{' '}
          extra. <code className="text-accent-primary font-mono">tf.purchase_credits(amount_usd=, private_key=)</code>{' '}
          handles the full quote + sign + broadcast + confirm flow in one call. The token is
          stored on the client and used for subsequent premium calls. Equivalent flows exist in
          the TypeScript SDK and via direct curl + a wallet of your choice.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-text-primary pt-2">If you are running an API and want to accept agent payments</h2>
        <p>
          Implement x402 on at least one paid endpoint. Verify the USDC Transfer event log
          server-side rather than trusting the tx hash. Implement replay protection at the
          tx-hash level. Publish a discovery manifest at{' '}
          <code className="text-accent-primary font-mono">/.well-known/x402</code>. Document the
          legal entity behind the wallet so paying agents can audit the counterparty. The full
          rationale is in <Link href="/originals/why-usdc-over-stripe" className="text-accent-primary hover:underline">why we picked USDC on Base over Stripe</Link>.
