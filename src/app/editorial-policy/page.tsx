            TensorFeed.ai is an independent publication covering artificial intelligence,
            machine learning, model releases, API pricing, and the operational status of
            the AI stack. We publish two kinds of content: aggregated news (headlines and
            short snippets linked back to their original publishers) and original editorial
            articles written by the TensorFeed editorial team under{' '}

          <p>
            Our mission is to be the fastest, cleanest, most reliable source of truth for
            what is happening in AI, served equally well to human readers and to AI agents.
            We cover frontier model releases, open-source model ecosystems, AI APIs and
            pricing, agent frameworks, AI safety research, incidents and outages,
            benchmarks, and the companies that build and fund these systems. We do not
            cover unrelated consumer technology, politics outside its direct intersection
            with AI policy, or celebrity news.

            Aggregated news on TensorFeed is pulled from public RSS and JSON feeds

            publisher. We do not rehost full articles, reproduce full paragraphs of
            third-party reporting, or strip author bylines. Snippets are clipped to about
            150 to 200 characters.

            Where we quote or paraphrase another outlet in an original article, we name
            the outlet in-line and link to the source. Where a claim originates with a
            research paper, we link to the paper or its arXiv entry. Where we cite data
            (pricing, context length, benchmark scores), we link to the canonical page we

            clear. Headlines, summaries, and the first paragraph of each original article
            are written so that a reader can quickly tell the difference between news
            reporting, analysis, and opinion.
