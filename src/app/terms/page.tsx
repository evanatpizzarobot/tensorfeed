                Each USDC transaction can be used to mint credits exactly once. The transaction
                hash is recorded server-side on first use; submitting the same tx hash a second

              <p>
                All credit purchases are final and non-refundable. Once a purchase is confirmed
                on-chain and credits are minted to a bearer token, the funds will not be returned
                in USDC, fiat, or any other form. Because credits never expire and remain spendable
                indefinitely on terminalfeed.io and tensorfeed.ai, users are encouraged to purchase
                in small increments (for example, $1 USDC for 50 credits) until call volume is
                calibrated, then top up as needed. The sole remedy for a purchase that turns out to
                be larger than required is to spend the unused balance over time, including on the
                cross-site partner described in Section 17.8.

                Premium credits and bearer tokens are jointly redeemable on tensorfeed.ai and
                terminalfeed.io, both operated by Pizza Robot Studios LLC under a single
                credit-accounting system. TensorFeed is the system of record for credit balances.
                These Terms, including the Premium API provisions in this Section, apply to all
                calls made against your bearer token across the cross-site bundle. Where a sister
                site applies its own additional rules (for example, route-specific rate limits),
                those rules apply in addition to (not in lieu of) these Terms.

                By purchasing premium credits, by deploying an autonomous agent that purchases or
                holds premium credits on your behalf, or by accepting custody of a bearer token,
                you represent and warrant on a continuing basis that: (a) you are at least 18 years
                old, or the age of legal majority in your jurisdiction, and have full legal
                capacity and authority to enter into this agreement, including, where applicable,
                authority to bind any corporate or other entity on whose behalf you act; (b) you
                are not a person or entity subject to sanctions administered or enforced by the
                United States Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), the United States Department
                of State, the United Nations Security Council, the European Union, the United
                Kingdom HM Treasury, or any other applicable sanctions authority; (c) you are not
                located, established, ordinarily resident, or organized in any country or territory
                subject to comprehensive sanctions, currently including Cuba, Iran, North Korea,
                Syria, the Crimea region, the so-called Donetsk and Luhansk People&apos;s
                Republics, and any successor or analogous designation; (d) the funds used to
                acquire USDC and to pay for credits are derived from lawful sources and are not the
                proceeds of any criminal activity; (e) your use of the Premium API will comply with
                all applicable laws, including anti-money-laundering, counter-terrorism financing,
                export control, sanctions, securities, tax, and consumer-protection laws; and (f)
                you are not acting on behalf of, and will not transfer credits or bearer tokens to,
                any party with respect to whom any of the foregoing representations is or would
                become untrue. Breach of any representation in this Section is a material breach of
                these Terms and grounds for immediate token revocation under Section 17.11.

              <p>
                The Premium API is designed to be consumed by autonomous AI agents and other
                automated systems. When you deploy or operate such an agent and configure it,
                directly or indirectly, to access the Premium API, you remain solely responsible
                for: (i) the actions and omissions of the agent, including all on-chain
                transactions it initiates and all calls it makes; (ii) the bearer tokens it holds
                and the credits it spends; (iii) any decisions, including financial, investment,
                trading, operational, safety, medical, or legal decisions, made by the agent or by
                downstream systems on the basis of Premium API responses; and (iv) any losses,
                costs, or damages that result from the agent&apos;s behavior. Premium API responses
                are provided for informational and inference purposes only. Aggregated upstream
                data may be stale, partial, inaccurate, or unavailable, and nothing returned by the
                Premium API constitutes financial, investment, trading, legal, medical, or other
                professional advice. We are not a fiduciary, broker-dealer, investment adviser, or
                counterparty to any trade, and we assume no responsibility for outcomes arising

                We reserve the right, in our sole and reasonable discretion and with or without
                prior notice, to throttle, rate-limit, suspend, or permanently revoke any bearer
                token, to refuse to confirm any pending credit purchase, and to refuse future
                purchases originating from the same wallet, email, operator, or related party,
                where we determine in good faith that the associated activity: (i) violates these
                Terms or applicable law; (ii) constitutes fraud, money laundering, sanctions
                evasion, market manipulation, or other illicit conduct; (iii) materially degrades
                the Service for other users, including denial-of-service patterns, runaway loops,
                or scraping at volumes inconsistent with normal agent behavior; (iv) attempts to
                circumvent billing, replay confirmed transactions, share or distribute bearer
                tokens beyond a single agent or operator in a manner not reasonably contemplated by
                the cross-site bundle in Section 17.8, or otherwise manipulate the credit-accounting
                system; or (v) presents a security, regulatory, or reputational risk to the Service
                or to its operating entity. Where we revoke a bearer token under this Section, any
                unspent credits associated with that token are forfeited and are not subject to
                refund, reissuance, or any other compensation. Section 17.5 (no refunds) governs
                the financial consequences of any action taken under this Section.

                that materially reproduces the Premium API surface for third parties, or by any
                other means; (b) use the Premium API to build, train, fine-tune, evaluate, or
                improve any product, model, or service that competes, directly or indirectly, with
                the Service or with the cross-site partner described in Section 17.8; (c) scrape,
                mirror, or systematically download Premium API responses for the purpose of
                building a competing data-aggregation product or dataset; (d) attempt to
                reverse-engineer rate limits, billing logic, credit accounting, or signature
                verification; (e) submit requests at a volume that, in our reasonable judgment,
                exceeds normal agent operation, including through coordinated multi-token campaigns
                designed to evade per-token limits; (f) use Premium API responses in any way that
                violates the inference-only license in Section 17.1; or (g) embed Premium API
                access in any product or service marketed to, or knowingly used by, persons subject
                to the sanctions or jurisdictional restrictions in Section 17.9. For clarity,

              <p>
                USDC transfers on Base mainnet are technically irreversible, and once we have
                confirmed an inbound transaction and minted credits to a bearer token, we are not
                in a position to return the original USDC. Where, however, an underlying fiat-to-
                USDC purchase is later reversed, charged back, voided, or determined by us in good
                faith to have been funded fraudulently, by means of compromised credentials, or in
                violation of Section 17.9, we reserve the right, in addition to the remedies in
                Section 17.11, to: (i) freeze the bearer token associated with the affected
                purchase; (ii) reverse the corresponding credit grant in whole or in part; (iii)
                decline future purchases originating from the same wallet, email, device, or
                operator, and from any related party we reasonably identify; and (iv) report the
                matter to law enforcement, to regulators, and to the cross-site partner described
                in Section 17.8. The user or operator who submitted the original payment
                instruction shall indemnify the Released Parties against any losses, costs, fees,
                or liabilities we suffer as a result of such reversal, fraud, or compromise.
