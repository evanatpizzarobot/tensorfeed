## Setup with Claude Code

Add to your Claude Code MCP config (`~/.claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tensorfeed": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@tensorfeed/mcp-server"]
    }
  }
}
```

To enable premium tools, add the `env` block:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tensorfeed": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@tensorfeed/mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "TENSORFEED_TOKEN": "tf_live_..."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Setup with Claude Desktop

Add to Claude Desktop settings (same shape as above).

## Run Locally

```bash
npx @tensorfeed/mcp-server
# or with a token for premium endpoints
TENSORFEED_TOKEN=tf_live_... npx @tensorfeed/mcp-server
```

## Example Queries

Free tier:

- "What's happening in AI today?"
- "Is Claude down right now?"
- "Compare pricing between Claude Opus and GPT-4o"
- "Show me the latest AI research papers"
- "What's the status of all AI services?"

Premium tier (with `TENSORFEED_TOKEN` set):

- "Recommend the best AI model for code under $5 per million tokens"
- "Show the price history of Claude Opus 4.7 over the last 30 days"
- "What's Anthropic's uptime this month?"
- "Compare model pricing between April 1 and today"
- "Set up a webhook to my server when Claude goes down"
- "What's my credit balance?"

## Pricing

Premium tools cost 1 credit per call. Credits are 50 per $1 USDC at base rate, with volume discounts at $5 (10%), $30 (25%), and $200 (40%). See [tensorfeed.ai/developers/agent-payments](https://tensorfeed.ai/developers/agent-payments) for the full payment flow and trust attestation.

No refunds: all credit purchases are final per Section 17.5 of the [Terms](https://tensorfeed.ai/terms#premium). Credits do not expire and are jointly redeemable on tensorfeed.ai and terminalfeed.io, so the safe pattern is to buy small ($1 USDC for 50 credits) and top up as call volume is calibrated. Premium access is unavailable in OFAC-sanctioned jurisdictions; see Section 17.9.

## Data Source

All data comes from the [TensorFeed.ai API](https://tensorfeed.ai/developers), which aggregates from 15+ sources including Anthropic, OpenAI, Google AI, TechCrunch, The Verge, arXiv, Hacker News, and more. Updated every 10 minutes.
